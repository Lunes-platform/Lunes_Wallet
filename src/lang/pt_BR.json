                "paragraph1": "Lunes is the biggest crypto-currency in Latin America. It was developed by the core team of Lunes Platform, using innovative solutions, in a decentralized way and with total transparency, seeking solidity, massive adhesion and fast and cheap transactions. Lunes has a proprietary, open-source and collaborative blockchain. The blockchain of Lunes is prepared to store and guarantee the security of any type of information, not only of financial transactions. This enables us to use our blockchain to perform various processes in a decentralized way, such as document authenticity records, digital asset issuance and execution of smart contracts.",
                "paragraph2": "The validation of transactions on the Lunes network occurs through the Proof-of-Stake system, considered the safest validation scheme for blockchain. In Proof-of-Stake, any network participant with more than 5000 Lunes can become a network validator node, contributing to the security of transactions and gaining network transaction fees as a reward. In addition, with the leasing system anyone can join the network as a validator, lending the power of their Lunes to another node of the network.",
                "paragraph3": "Through our microblocks technology, the blockchain of Lunes is able to process a much larger volume of transactions when compared to the cryptomedas with greater market value. With smaller and faster blocks, transactions are validated cheaply and quickly, allowing Lunes to scale to achieve its primary goal",
