"Lunes is the biggest crypto-currency in Latin America. It was developed by "
"the core team of Lunes Platform, using innovative solutions, in a "
"decentralized way and with total transparency, seeking solidity, massive "
"adhesion and fast and cheap transactions. Lunes has a proprietary, open-"
"source and collaborative blockchain. The blockchain of Lunes is prepared to "
"store and guarantee the security of any type of information, not only of "
"financial transactions. This enables us to use our blockchain to perform "
"various processes in a decentralized way, such as document authenticity "
"records, digital asset issuance and execution of smart contracts."

"The validation of transactions on the Lunes network occurs through the "
"Proof-of-Stake system, considered the safest validation scheme for "
"blockchain. In Proof-of-Stake, any network participant with more than 5000 "
"Lunes can become a network validator node, contributing to the security of "
"transactions and gaining network transaction fees as a reward. In addition, "
"with the leasing system anyone can join the network as a validator, lending "
"the power of their Lunes to another node of the network."
